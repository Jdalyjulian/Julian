            I have taught middle school science and dance for the past 9 years. I
            was around for the transition from pen and paper to shared devices,
            and then from shared devices to students learning in a 1-1 device
            ratio. I was then quickly tasked to create an online curriculum due to
            the pandemic and closure of in-person education. During this time, I
            learned how to transition the typical hands on lab investigations into
            a virtual field. I also managed to produce a beautiful dance performs
            through the powers of zoom and video recording.
            <br />
            <br />
            Now the challenge, back in the classroom, is to determine the value of
            physical assignments versus digital assignments. I am determining what
            curriculum from the pandemic is worth keeping and determining what
            curriculum is better learned the "old fashioned" way, with pen and
            paper.

            After dancing, I attended the University of Texas at Austin, where I
            walked onto the Women's Rowing Team. During my novice year, the Big
            XII conference held its inagural Big XII Rowing Championship where I
            help secure a victory in the 1st Novice 8. I was voted the Most
            Valuable Rower by ny novice squad. I then advanced to the Varsity
            squad where I rowed in the Varsity 4. During my time on Varsity, I won
            another Big XII Championship, as well as a Conference USA
            Championship.

            After college and a round of watching the winter Olympics on TV, I
            decided to try out of the USA Skeleton team. I trained back at The
            University of Texas and attended the combine. While I did not recieve
            an invitation to move on, I like to share this story because to this
            day, I still have yet to try the sport of Skeleton. You see, you have
            to try out for the team before ever actually doing the sport.

            I am a former ballerina and danced with Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre in
            their Graduate Program. Prior to Pittsburgh, I danced in the
            pre-professional ballet company, Kingwood Dance Theatre. During my
            time dancing, I had the opportunity to tour through Austria and
            Germany with the Young! Tanzsommer program. I also studied with
            Houston Ballet, Boston Ballet, and The Joffrey Ballet during their
            summer intensives.

            SheCodes program. I have the basics of html, js, and css down and look
            forward to learning new things and creating projects that I am proud
            of.
